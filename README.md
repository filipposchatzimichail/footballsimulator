# Football Simulator

## A C# .NET Core solution that simulates a football tournament.

#### The solution consists of two self executing applications (a Console app and a Blazor app). It features separation of concerns and unit testing while following the SOLID and KISS principles. 

The solution currrently uses 4 teams (Italy, Spain, Portugal and Netherlands) but is highly configurable (see settings.json) and well tested by tournaments consisting of 100 teams.

**1. FootballSimulator.API**

**2. FootballSimulator.Blazor**

**3. FootballSimulator.ConsoleApp**

**4. FootballSimulator.Data**

**5. FootballSimulator.Services**

**6. FootballSimulator.Tests**
